/**
 * `currentBuildId()` — a stable identity for the running **PTY-host source**,
 * used to decide whether a surviving PTY-host daemon is running *stale code*
 * after a deploy.
 *
 * The #1031 production failure was a staleness check keyed on `pkgVersion`,
 * a build-invariant constant (`"0.1.0"`): `outdated` was *always false*, so
 * the "update pending" nudge never fired and a 20-hour-old daemon was reused
 * across every redeploy. The first fix keyed on the whole-binary nix store
 * hash (`/nix/store/<hash>-kolu-stamped/...` via `argv[1]`), which over-fired
 * the opposite way: EVERY deploy — even ones that never touched `@kolu/pty-
 * host` — flipped `outdated` true and nudged the user to restart, and acting
 * on that nudge costs a terminal-losing daemon restart for zero benefit.
 *
 * Constraint #6 fix: key on a build-time hash of *just the pty-host source*,
 * baked by nix into `KOLU_PTY_HOST_BUILD_ID` (see `default.nix`). Both the
 * server and the daemon inherit that one constant from the environment (the
 * supervisor forwards env to the daemon), so they compute the SAME key —
 * `outdated` now flips ONLY when restarting actually picks up new terminal-
 * host code. Server- or client-only deploys no longer nudge.
 *
 * Precedence (highest → lowest), see `resolveBuildId`:
 *   1. `KOLU_BUILD_ID_OVERRIDE` — test seam (forces a mismatch in e2e).
 *   2. `KOLU_PTY_HOST_BUILD_ID` — the pty-host source hash baked by nix; the
 *      real production key.
 *   3. `deriveBuildId(argv[1])` — dev/tsx fallback, stable across restarts in
 *      a worktree so `just dev` never sees spurious "update pending".
 *
 * This is staleness keying only. Hard contract incompatibility (the daemon
 * speaks a wire protocol the server can't talk to) is a *separate*, forced-
 * restart path — see `PTY_HOST_CONTRACT_VERSION` in `ptyHostSurface.ts`.
